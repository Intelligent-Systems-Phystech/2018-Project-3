  abstract  = {Time series clustering is one of the crucial tasks in
		 time series data mining. The most popular method in
		 time series clustering is k-means algorithm due to its
		 simplicity and flexibility. So far, k-means for time
		 series clustering has been most used with Euclidean
		 distance. Dynamic time warping (DTW) distance measure
		 has increasingly been used as a similarity measurement
		 for various data mining tasks in place of traditional
		 Euclidean distance due to its superiority in
		 sequence-alignment flexibility. However, there exist
		 some difficulties in clustering with DTW distance, for
		 example, the problem of shape averaging in DTW or the
		 problem of speeding up DTW distance calculation. In
		 this paper, we compare the performance of the three
		 shape averaging methods in DTW: nonlinear alignment and
		 averaging filter (NLAAF), prioritised shape averaging
		 (PSA) and DTW barycenter averaging (DBA) and propose an
		 efficient method to implement k-means clustering for
		 time series data with DTW distance. In our method, we
		 choose to use DBA method for shape-based time series
		 averaging, apply early abandoning method for speeding
		 up DTW distance calculation and median-based method for
		 determining initial centroids for k-means clustering.
		 The experimental results on benchmark datasets validate
		 our proposed implementation method for time series
		 k-means clustering with DTW.},

  abstract  = {The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growths of interests in applications that deal with querying and mining of time series data. Numerous representation methods for dimensionality reduction and similarity measures geared towards time series have been introduced. Each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive set of time series experiments re-implementing 8 different representation methods and 9 similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this paper, we give an overview of these different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. Our experiments have provided both a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, and in some cases, suggested that certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.},

  abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research.},

  abstract = {Clustering is a solution for classifying enormous data when there is not any early knowledge about classes. With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using un-supervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.},
